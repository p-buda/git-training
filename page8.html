   <h1>Cloning vs. Forking</h1>
   <h2>Clone a repository</h2>
   <p>Cloning is good when you want a copy of the original project on your local machine but you don't intend to contribute back to the original project.</p>
   <p>The other scenario, this is our case, is that you are invited as a collaborator.</p>
   <p>When you clone a repository, you are not linked with the remote. 
   You can't create pull requests back to the original remote <strong>unless</strong> you are invited as a collaborator and can contribute back.</p>
   
   <h2>Fork a repository</h2>
   <p>You can fork (create a local copy) of any publicly visible repository on GitHub.</p>
   <p>A fork is always linked to the parent repository and is always public.</p>
   <p>It is good for open-source projects collaboration when you want to bring in new ideas to the project and create pull requests.</p>
