   <h1>Git &amp; Remote</h1>
   <h2>Adding your code from your local repository to a remote repository</h2>
   <p>GitHub is that remote location for you (you can just call it a <em>remote</em>).</p>
   <h3>Command for adding a remote repository's "bookmark" to your local repository</h3>
   <p>Note that we are not downloading any code yet with this command! It is just like a bookmark.</p>
   <div>
      <pre>
         <code>git remote add origin <i>LOCATION OF THE REMOTE REPOSITORY</i></code>
      </pre>
   </div>
   <p>Know that <code>origin</code> is the arbitrary name of that remote location and that's the name we see used most often by default.</p>
   <h3>Command for pushing your code to the remote repository</h3>
   <p>Now that you have the remote repository "bookmarked" in your local repo, you can push the code from the local to the remote. Here is how:</p>
   <div>
      <pre>
         <code>git push origin master</code>
      </pre>
   </div>
   <p>Know that <code>master</code> is the name of our local repository's main branch.</p>
   <p>If we push to the remote repository a lot, we can create a shortcut version of the previous command by typing this:</p>
   <div>
      <pre>
         <code>git push -u origin master</code>
      </pre>
   </div>
   <p>After we press Enter, the next time we want to push from master to the origin, we can type only</p>
   <div>
      <pre>
         <code>git push</code>
      </pre>
   </div>
   <h3>How to check your bookmarks, that is, how to know what remotes you are connected to?</h3>
   <p>Type this command to see the list of all your remotes.</p>
   <div>
      <pre>
         <code>git remote -v</code>
      </pre>
   </div>
</body>
