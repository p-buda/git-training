   <h1>Git &amp; Merging Branches</h1>
   <h2>Before you merge</h2>
   <p>Before you merge your branches, move to the branch that is your main one (or the one you want the changes to be merged to.) In our case, it will be <code>master</code>.</p>
   <div>
      <pre>
         <code>git checkout master</code>
      </pre>
   </div>
   <h2>Merging</h2>
   <p>Now, we are ready to merge the branches.</p>
   <div>
      <pre>
         <code>git merge <i>branch_name</i></code>
      </pre>
   </div>
   <h2>Solving merge conflicts</h2>
   <p>When you try to merge two branches that have the same file but each has a different code in the same line, you will get a <em>merge conflict</em>. In that case, you have to tell Git which version you want to keep. This is how you can solve the merging conflicts.</p>
   <p>Open the file that has a conflict. The conflicting line versions are added into the same file on your current branch and you can decide which lines of the code to keep and which to delete.</p>
   <p>Once you are done editing, you have to add and commit the changes, explaining your choice in solving the conflict.</p>
   <div>
      <pre>
         <code>git add <i>file_name</i></code>
         <code>git commit -m '<i>Message about your choice in the merge conflict.</i>'</code>
      </pre>
   </div>
   <p>After that, the branches are merged and they both point to the HEAD of the main branch.</p>
   <h2>Deleting branches</h2>
   <p>After your additional branch was merged with the main branch of your project, you can delete it if you no longer need it. To do that, use this command:</p>
   <div>
      <pre>
         <code>git branch -d <i>branch_name</i></code>
      </pre>
   </div>
   <p>Note that Git will not allow you to delete a branch that was not merged. But you can force it with the upper case "d," like so: <code>git branch -D <i>branch_name</i></code>.
