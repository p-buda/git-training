   <h1>Git Basics</h1>
   <h2>What is Git?</h2>
   <p>Git is an open-source program that enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" target="_blank"><em>version control</em></a> in your projects. Git helps you track changes in your project files as the project progresses.</p>
   <p>How does Git keep track of the changes? When you work on a project, for example, you write a program, and you just added a new feature or fixed a bug, you can tell Git to save the current version of your project.</p>
   <p>Later you can always revert to any of the saved versions of your project if needed.</p>
   <p>Git also allows you to create multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_(version_control)" target="_blank"><em>branches</em></a> (that is, versions) of your project that can be merged later. That is very useful when you work on a project with a team of developers. Each developer can focus on one feature and then all these features can be merged into the main project (in Git, called <em>master branch</em>).</p>

   <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
   <p>You have a general idea what Git version control program is. So, what is <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> then? GitHub is one of the cloud-based storage systems that integrate with Git. GitHub allows us to store the project files from our local Git repositories on a remote server so we can easily retrieve them and, most importantly, collaborate with other developers on projects.</p>
   <p>The free version of GitHub allows you to store your project files in a way that is public, that is, anyone can see your source code and anyone can download it. <em>That is why you never want to upload to GitHub passwords or any other personal information.</em> Since January 2019 you can also choose to create free private repositories. See more at this <a href="https://github.blog/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/" target="_blank">article</a>.</p>
   <p>There is a great benefit of the public repositories. Organizations like NASA or Microsoft and individuals publish their source code on GitHub in this way and hope that some other developers will download their code and add to it something great that will improve their product or find a bug that would go unnoticed otherwise. That's how open-source projects are being built!</p>
   <p>GitHub also has an enterprise version that allows organizations to use it in their private space where nobody from the outside has access to their code. You might use GitHub in this way in your future job.</p>
   <p>In this class, you will create your own, free GitHub account. But you will also have access to the non-public, SCC repositories for our class.</p>
